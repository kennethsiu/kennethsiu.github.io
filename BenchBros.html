    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
    BenchBros is a mobile application created by two software developers, and one graphics artist.
    It is a simple game inspired by our dedication to working out, and our motivation behind creating it was to create a new game that users could play to replace Flappy Birds when the owner took it down from the app store.

    My role for this project was an Android software developer.
    As a developer, I created a lot of the core functionality, such as background transitioning, logic design of which stage to enter, touch screen response, and random time generator.

    <br><br>
    
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
        The development process for this application spanned over 36 hours.
        There was no real software development methodology used, as this project was developed at a Hackathon, and there was no need and time to instill a strict process.

        The first step was to find a group to work on this project together.
        Initially, I had already known the other software developer in the group.
        We eventually added a third member, who was our graphics specialist.
        During the first couple of hours, our group was debating on what kind of project we wanted to work on.
        All of the members of the team enjoyed working out, so we were leaning towards creating a fitness app, but we ultimately steered away from that option because there were already so many existing fitness apps that track your workouts.
        Instead, we decided to create a game in hopes to replace Flappy Birds, as the owner of Flappy Birds took down the app during that period.

        <br>
        After deciding on creating a game, we drew several preliminary rough sketches on what we wanted the game to end up looking like.
        Once we had a rough idea of what we wanted to develop, we began coding.

        <br>
        The entire application was done in <b>C#</b>, and we used <b>Unity</b> as the IDE for development.
        C# is the primary language for Unity, and all of the team developers wanted to learn a new language.
        The first major feature we implemented was the background transitioning between each stage.
        For example, we had a home screen page, a game page, and a "how to play" page.
        We had to develop functionality to allow users to switch from one screen to the next.
        The second major feature we implemented was touch screen response and random time generator.
        We needed to track if the user tapped the screen before the time was up.
        We also implemented the random time functionality so that users could not strictly time the next moment to press the screen, or there would be no challenge.
        <br>
        <br>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      The most difficult part of this project was that we only had 36 hours to develop a working product.
      Not only was there a severe time constraint, none of us used Unity or C# before.
      This required a lot of Googling and patience, but we ultimately developed an application for users to enjoy.
      <br><br>
      In addition, I had already known the other software developer prior to the project, but we needed to find a graphics artist.
      This took a while to find one who was willing to join our team, and we did not have much time to get to know each that well other due to time restrictions.
